-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs is as simple as listening to their experiences, problems, and ideas. Creating user stories is a simple way of doing this. For example, if a user says, "I wish I could see more options." that is a prime feature request and an ideal user story.
-How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing a program as solving problems logically. Ideally, I hope to incorporate the agile mindset of face to face communication and self suffiency. 
-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development comes down to mutual respect. The respect to listen to others, trust each other to get the work done, and to listen to each other's ideas in good faith.
